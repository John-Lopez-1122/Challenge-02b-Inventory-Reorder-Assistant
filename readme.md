Project complete. Note: Im not sure if I am supposed to upload my own console logs or if this is done on the grader side. I know the logs work because I tested them but I dont know if I have to show my logs or how. Anyway, this took a bit less then an hour. Could have done it faster but having 3 windows open on one screen is an interesting challenge. With that, I will continue for next weeks assignment. Please feel free to message me at any time using my email: johnplopez123@gmail.com or through Github. Thank you!
